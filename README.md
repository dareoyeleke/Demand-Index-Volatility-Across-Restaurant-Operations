# 📊 Demand Volatility in the Hospitality Industry
## A Data-Driven Analysis of Operational Risk and Customer Behavior
### 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes demand volatility across restaurant operations to identify the structural drivers behind unstable revenue patterns. Rather than focusing on revenue levels alone, the analysis examines how and when volatility occurs, enabling more informed operational and staffing decisions.

Using transactional data, the project evaluates how restaurant type, time patterns, and environmental conditions influence fluctuations in demand.

### 🎯 Objectives

-  Quantify demand volatility across restaurant formats

-  Identify temporal drivers (weekday vs weekend effects)

-  Assess the impact of external stressors (weather, promotions)

-  Translate analytical findings into operational insights

### Data Set Acquired From 
-  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farukalam/yelp-restaurant-reviews

### 🧠 Key Questions Addressed

-  Which restaurant types experience the highest demand volatility?

-  Do weekends materially increase volatility?

-  Are promotions effective in driving demand?

-  What operational factors contribute most to instability?

**How demand changes across days and weeks.**

**Insights**

-  With the exception of Fine Dining and Kopitiam locations which show opposing trends, Weekend demand is significantly more volatile

-  Seasonal effects are present but secondary to behavioral patterns

-  Huge in Volatility for august and then Sharp fall for September perharps signalling beginning of school period

-  Huge Difference in Volatility from End of year Holiday Season and January as Families contribute to demand in December, and then individuals follow trends such as Dry January leading to a High change in Volatility
